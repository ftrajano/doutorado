        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Construction projects are becoming increasingly challenging, resulting in more complex and dynamic construction environments. Despite this, traditional management and monitoring methods are currently unable to keep up with the industry’s rapid development, leading to several problems in task efficiency and transfer of information between project delivery stages...</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Architecture Engineering Construction and Operations (AECO) sector, among other relevant industry segments, is continuously faced with increasing competitive and complex projects despite the tending shorter budgets and due dates...</p>

        <h2>2. Methodology</h2>
        <p>The methodology applied in this study was based on the systematic review protocol of Sidani et al. As stated in the protocol, the Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used...</p>

        <h2>3. Results</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Selected Articles</h3>
        <p>As seen in Fig. 1, a total of 16 articles remained after the screening processes. The research was completely performed using electronic databases, which provided easy access to databases found in Index and E-Journals, such as: Academic Search Complete; Current Contents; Web of Science; SCOPUS; INSPEC; ScienceDirect; Cambridge Journals Online; Directory of Open Access Journals; Emerald Fulltext; Taylor and Francis Online; Oxford Journals; SAGE Journals Online; SciELO; SpringerLink; Wiley Online Library; ACM Digital Library; ASME Digital Collection; ASCE; IEEE Xplore; IOP Journals; ScienceDirect; SIAM...</p>

        <h3>3.2 Presence of Bias Within the Selected Articles</h3>
        <p>Bias can be defined as any trend that prevents the incontestable consideration of an issue. A systematic error introduced in sampling, testing or analysis, as well as implicitly or explicitly supporting one result is also considered bias...</p>

        <h2>4. Discussion</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Summary of Evidence</h3>
        <p>The present paper reviewed 16 articles. Of these articles, most focused on enhancing teamwork, communication and cross-team interaction, which is a common objective for VR related articles in general...</p>

        <h2>5. Conclusions</h2>
        <p>The systematic review included 16 articles, these articles were chosen for displaying three main characteristics: an immersive reality functionality; an assessment method of their applications; and VR environments originated from BIM...</p>

        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
